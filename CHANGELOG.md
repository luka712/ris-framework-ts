# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- Initial release setup. `development` publishes a prerelease on the npm `next` tag. `main` publishes this version on `latest`.
- The package entry is compiled JavaScript and declarations in `dist`. Consumers import `Framework`, `FrameworkConfig`, `TextureSamplerFilteringPreset`, and the types formerly published as `ris-framework-api` from `ris-framework` without compiling this repository. Built-in shaders and the browser KTX2 loader are included in that JavaScript.
- The package license is Apache License 2.0. Copyright 2026 Luka Erkapic.
